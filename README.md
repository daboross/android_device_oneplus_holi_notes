OnePlus Nord N200 5G Notes
==========================

## Foreword: Codewords

- dre9 is the codeword for the North America (carrier independent) edition of the OnePlus Nord N200 5G
- dre8t is the codeword for the T-Mobile locked edition of the OnePlus Nord N200 5G
- holi is the codeword for the sm4350 platform. Because it shows up as the "codeword" in the bootloader menu, it's
  been mistaken as the codeword for the OnePlus Nord N200 5G in general.
